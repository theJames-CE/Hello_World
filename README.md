# Hello_World

<h1>Assignment: Hello World</h1>

<p>It's time to start creating Python files! As a rite of passage, our first program needs to be Hello World. Letâ€™s practice string concatenation. Copy the code below, replacing each of the <i>your code here</i> placeholders with the appropriate values. Hopefully it's not too patronizing that every other task below is running the file--this is just a friendly reminder to get into the habit of testing your code regularly!</p>
